# Feegrant

## Introduction

The Secret Network **Fee Grant** module is an interesting and powerful feature that allows accounts to grant allowances to other accounts, enabling them to pay fees for transactions from the allowance. This feature opens up numerous possibilities, and one popular use case involves subsidizing the onboarding process for new users who may not possess the native network token required to execute initial transactions.

This guide provides basic solutions for achieving two key goals: first, granting users an allowance on the Secret Network, and second, enabling the end user to use this allowance to execute transactions.
