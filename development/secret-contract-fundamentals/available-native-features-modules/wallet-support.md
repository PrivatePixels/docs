# Wallet support

Secret has integrations with the following wallets:

* Keplr
* Leap
* Fina.Cash (mobile friendly)
* Starshell (added privacy)
* Metamask (only signing, not SCRT storage)
* Cosmostation
* Citadel.One

You can check out app.shadeprotocol.io or dash.scrt.network to try out these various wallets. \


{% hint style="info" %}
**Secret Network is the only non-EVM cosmos chain that supports native Metamask signing!**\
\
It is an awesome onboarding tool for new users or can be the missing tool to have people use Secret in your Privacy as a Service flow without ever needing a 2nd wallet or other gas.
