# Bridge (messaging/tokens)

Secret network has active integrations with:

* [Axelar GMP](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/overview)
  * Using IBC Hooks, a contract on Ethereum can call a contract on Secret and get a response back.
* Axelar Satellite
  * Using the Axelar SDK users can bridge Ethereum and other EVM/Non-EVM assets into Cosmos and Secret arriving immediately as Wrapped SNIP-20 private tokens into their Secret account.
* [Andromeda Protocol](https://andromedaprotocol.io/)
  * Leveraging IBC users can utilise andromeda digital objects to improve their development speed and interact more easily with cross-chain app functionality.
